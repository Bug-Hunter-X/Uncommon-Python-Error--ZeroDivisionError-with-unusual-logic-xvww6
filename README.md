This repository contains a Python function that exhibits unexpected behavior due to a combination of zero division and non-standard control flow.  The `bug.py` file demonstrates the issue, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version that handles potential errors more gracefully. The main error is that the function does not explicitly handle the case where both inputs are 0.
